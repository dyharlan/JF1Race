# JF1Race
 Port of the F1 Race game to Java/Swing
 This uses code made from the JS version of the game by nehochupechatat: https://github.com/nehochupechatat/nehochupechatat.github.io
 
## Status
 The base gameplay is 100% functional at this point, only missing is the high-score and menu systems. Some renderer bugs are still present though.

## Acknowledgements
 Thank you to [nehochupechatat](https://github.com/nehochupechatat) for providing the original source code of F1-Race and his MTKGameFramework  Wrapper. 
 Thank you to the Kahvibreak community for providing an inclusive community for mobile preservation. Something that a certain Historical Foundation seemed to ignore.
 Thank you to MediaTek for creating this abomination of a video game.

## Build
 Requires Java JDK 8 minimum to compile and a sufficiently up-to-date version of netbeans. Just load the project to Netbeans and hit "Clean and Build Project" to produce a jar file.
