# JF1Race
 Port of the F1 Race game to Java/Swing
 This uses code made from the JS version of the game by nehochupechatat: https://github.com/nehochupechatat/nehochupechatat.github.io
 There's still a lot of things to implement.
 Right now, the only things working are:
    - A primitive render loop
